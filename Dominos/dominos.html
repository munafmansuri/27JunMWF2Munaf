    <h2>Domino's Pizza: Delivering Happiness</h2>
    <p>What’s better than having a crispy melty pizza, you ask?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Having that crispy and melty pizza in the comfort of your own home with the ones you love, we say.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With Domino's it is always “Rishton ka time”. Whether it's a treat for your promotion, a kid topping his class or
        winning the heart of your wife who is too tired to cook after a long day at work! A cheesy slice of the best
        pizza is all one needs to put things into perspective and start any celebration. Plus, you do not even need to
        rush to the restaurant to have one now. A call, a few clicks on our website or a few touches on the mobile
        screen is all you have to do to have that tempting, light-on-the-pocket pizza at your doorstep.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is something for everyone here. The vegetarians, non-vegetarians, the sides’ lovers and also the ones who
        love to have something sweet by the time they reach the last bite of the last slice of pizza slice. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>What We Need - More Choice. More Fun.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your
        toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh tomato, red
        paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri
        chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and
        everything you can think of that too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin
        crust, cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's
        understands you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        And to shoo away those end-of-the-month blues while placing your order with our pizza restaurant, check out the
        everyday pizzas from pizza mania combos with everyday value offer of 2 pizzas starting at just ₹99 (regular
        size) and ₹199 (medium size) each.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        The promise of 30-minute Delivery
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The icing on the cake or more aptly the extra cheese on your already fabulous pizza is that Domino’s takes only
        half an hour for its pizza delivery service. Don’t believe us? Time it if you please. With 1250+ stores present
        all over India, you can have a Domino’s pizza even while traveling on a train. Yes, you are reading it right,
        you can enjoy pizza on train too.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order from your nearest pizza outlet to have a hot box of
        pizza on your table in the next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting station.
