                <h2>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid
                system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While
                containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>

                <p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5.

                    The default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.

                    In addition, all &#60;p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>

            </li>
            <br>
            <p>“Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create series of buttons in
                groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally.

                This is the basic syntax of the button group class where each button has its own class of “btn”.
                <br> <br>
                &#60;div class="btn-group">
                &#60;button type="button" class="btn"> Click &#60;/button>
    </div>

    <p>Buttons have a default border-radius on the first and last buttons of the group.</p>

    <p> Styles on Buttons: Bootstrap allows you to add styles to your buttons using the following classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> .btn-default</p>
        </li>

                    <p>Step 1: Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the &#60;head> tag before all other stylesheets to
                        load our CSS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 2: Add &#60;div> tag in the HTML body with class row. In that &#60;div> create four div
                        sections to create four images.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 3: Add “col-sm-6” and “col-md-3” to four div sections which creates webpage responsive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 4: Add <a> tag with class value thumbnail to define the link of the image in the next line.

                            &#60;a href="#" class="thumbnail"></p>

                <h2>In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>Flexbox. The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox,
                instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design
                flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>

            </li>
            <br>
            <p>Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling,
                use one of the eight required contextual classes </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                (e.g., .alert-success, .alert alert-primary, .alert alert-secondary, .alert alert-success, .alert
                alert-danger, .alert alert-warning, .alert alert-info, .alert alert-light, .alert alert-dark)

                <h2>What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a
                wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you’re familiar
                with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those
                components is available as modifier classes for cards.</p>
