            CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the
            style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, etc. CSS saves time −
            You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.

                <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among web browsers.
                    With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to
                    test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
                <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
                <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change
                    affects on all the browsers.</li>
                <li>The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of
                    CSS
                    i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
                <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
                <li>CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li>
                <li>There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.</li>
                <li>There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind
                an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency</li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>To set the background color in HTML, use the style attribute. The style attribute specifies an inline
                style for an element. The attribute is used with the HTML &lt;body> tag, with the CSS property
                background-color. HTML5 do not support the &lt;body> tag bgcolor attribute, so the CSS style is used to
                add background color.</li>

        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use
                no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case,
                the image will display only once.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The background-position property in CSS is mainly used to sets the initial position for the background
                image ie., it is used to set an image at a certain position. The position that is relative to the
                positioning layer, can be set by using the background-origin property.

        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <p>There are two reasons behind this:</p>
            <li>
                It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if
                it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
            </li>
            <li>Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.</li>

                The “blocks” are known for taking full line space, forcing other elements to start on a new line. In
                other words, they have a width of 100% of the webpage or container holding the block. In this article,
                we are going to see how to block elements that usually behave and how to center them using CSS.

        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS is used to separate the HTML content from the representation rules to make it easier to maintain the
                content style in a centralized manner. Basically, all the style info is contained in another file. This
                makes the HTML code so much lighter and easier to read and edit. </li>
            <li>CSS offers a lot of possibilities of working with big amounts of content. For example, with CSS
                Counters, you can quickly change the appearance of all lists, paragraphs, tables, and other elements
                that have repeated tags within them. </li>
            <li>As CSS is used to fulfill many specific design related tasks, there’s a lot of information on the
                Internet about various CSS tricks, workarounds, and life-hacks. If you want to become a CSS pro, then
                you should never stop learning new things about this special language. As an example of what CSS can do,
