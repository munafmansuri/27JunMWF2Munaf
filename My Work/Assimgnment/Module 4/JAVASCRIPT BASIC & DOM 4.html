                <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
                pages
                — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at
                —
                displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
                etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of
                standard
                web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the
                Learning Area.</p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The <span> <b> isNaN </b> </span>function is used to determine whether a value is "NaN" (not a number) or
                not. <span> <b>
                        isNaN </b> </span> is a top-level function and is not associated with any object.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What is negative Infinity?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>The Infinity is a property of the global object. In other words, it’s a global variable.

                    The initial value of the Infinity is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY, which is greater than other finite
                    numbers.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript also has a negative Infinity (-Infinity) where its value is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY. The
                    -Infinity is smaller than any finite number.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <h2>Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to conform
                to
                ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. Undefined variables
                are
                those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>Creation of new element: New elements can be created in JS by using the createElement() method. Syntax:
                document. createElement
                ("&lt;tagName>"); // Where &lt;tagName> can be any HTML // tagName like div, ul, button, etc. // newDiv
                element has been created For Eg: let newDiv = document.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>

            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The difference between ‘ViewState’ and ‘SessionState’, ‘ViewState’ is particular to a page in a session.
            </p>
            <br>
            <span> Whereas,</span>
            <br>
            <p> ‘SessionState’ is specific to user on particular data that can be accessed across all pages in the
                web application.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What is === operator?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The strict equality operator ( === ) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean
                result.
                Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types
                to
                be different.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    How can the style/class of an element be changed?
                </h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The class name is used as a selector in HTML which helps to give some value to the element attributes.
                The
                document.getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document with the “id” attribute
                and
                the “className” attribute can be used to change/append the class of the element.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The <span><b>fs.readFile()</b></span> and <span><b>rs.writeFile()</b></span> methods are used to read and
                write of a file using javascript. The file
                is read using the <span><b>fs.readFile()</b></span> function, which is an inbuilt method. This technique
                reads the full file
                into memory and stores it in a buffer.</p>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
                </h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h5>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object </h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</h5>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or
                value
                to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second
                argument
                of parseInt() function.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are
                no
                more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.

                <h2>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.
                    </b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Alert Box</b></h4>
                <p>An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

                    When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Confirm Box</b></h4>
                <p>A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.

                    When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.

                    If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Prompt Box</b></h4>
                <p>A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

                    When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after
                    entering
                    an input value.

                    If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns
                    null.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>You might have occasionally came across “javascript:void(0)” in an HTML Document. It is often used when
                inserting an expression in a web page might produce some unwanted effect. To remove this effect,
                “javascript:void(0)” is used. This expression returns undefined primitive value. This is often used with
                hyperlinks. Sometimes, you will decide to call some JavaScript from inside a link. Normally, when you
                click
                a link, the browser loads a brand new page or refreshes the same page (depending on the URL specified).
                But
                you most likely don’t desire this to happen if you have hooked up some JavaScript thereto link. To
                prevent
                the page from refreshing, you could use void(0). Using “#” in anchor tag: When writing the following
                code in
                the editor, the web page is refreshed after the alert message is shown.</p>
        </ul>

            <li>
                <h2>
                    How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
                </h2>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in
                Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the
                document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>

                <h2>
                    What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
                </h2>
            </li>
            <p>Disadvantages of innerHTML It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have
                to
                parse the content again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event
                handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.</p>
