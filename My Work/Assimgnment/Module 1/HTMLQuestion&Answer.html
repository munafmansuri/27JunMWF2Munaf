    <p><b>Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</b></p>
    <p>HTML Tags are the labels or entity that create web pages. Each tag provides special meaning for the content.<br>
        For example:<td>&#60;p&#62;</td>is paragraph tag.<br>
        HTML element is a combination of start tag, content and an end tag. Mostly, website content is written inside start tag ( <td> &#60;p&#62; </td>) and an end tag ( <td> &#60;/p&#62; </td>).<br>
        For example:<td> &#60;p&#62; </td>This is sample content 
        ( <td> &#60;/p&#62; </td>) represents HTML element

    <p><b>What are tags and attributes in HTML?</b></p>
     <i>What is Tag in HTML</i>
    <p> Html contains various elements to build the content. Elements such as paragraph, 
        horizontal lines and headings are used to develop the structure of all webpages. 
        Programmer cannot write these elements directly on the website. 
        He has to use tags to write specific elements to the webpage. 
        Most elements have a start tag and an end tag. 
        In other words, the elements are enclosed within the start and end tag. 
        Furthermore, elements such as line break and horizontal line do not have close tags. 
        Few example HTML elements with tags are as follows.</p>

        <i>What is Attribute in HTML</i>
        <p>An attribute provides extra information about an HTML element. 
            It has two sections: the name of the attribute and the value of that attribute. 
            The name defines the property that we require to set, 
            while the value is a property that defines the value of that property. 
            The programmer can write the value inside quotations.</p>

  <p><b>How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</b></p>
  <p>Cellpadding and Cellspacing are the attributes used in table formatting, 
    it actually sets the whitespaces in your table cells. 
    These are the significant properties of a web document. 
    The main difference between cellpadding and cellspacing is that 
    the cellpadding is used to fix the width between the cell edge and its content. 
    Conversely, the cellspacing sets the space between the single cells.
    The width of these attributes can be measured by using pixels or percentage.
    For adjusting the space between text and surrounded cell wall, 
    cells and cells within a table tag, the attributes such as cellpadding and cellspacing are used</p>

    <p><b>How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?</b></p>
    <p>You can merge two or more table cells in a column by using the colspan attribute in a HTML tag (table data). 
       To merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute.
       If you want to combine the first two cells in the first column, you can use the colspan="2" attribute in the first tag. 
       The number represents how many cells to use (merge) for the tag.
       However, If you want to combine the first two cells in the first column into one cell, 
       you can use the rowspan="2" attribute in the first tag. The number represents how many cells to use for the tag</p>

    <p><b>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</b></p>
    <p>
      <u>Block Level Elements</u><br>
      A block-level element is an HTML element that begins a new line on a web page and extends the full width of the available horizontal space of its parent element. It creates large blocks of content like paragraphs or page divisions. In fact, most HTML elements are block-level elements.
      Block-level elements are used within the HTML document's body. They can contain inline elements, as well as other block-level elements.
      <br>
      <u>Inline Elements</u>
      <ul>
        <li>It can begin within a line.</li>
        <li>It does not start a new line.</li>
        <li>Its width only extends as far as it is defined by its tags.</li> 
        </ul>
          An example of an inline element is the &#60; strong &#62;, which makes the font of the text content contained within boldface. 
          An inline element generally only contains other inline elements, or it can contain nothing at all, 
          such as the &#60;br /&#62; break tag.

      tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The &lt;a&gt; tag
      indicates where the hyperlink starts and the &lt;/a&gt; tag indicates
      where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a
      hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the &lt;a href=” ”&gt;.

      The &#60;span&#62; tag is much like the &#60;div> element, 
      but &#60;div> is a block-level element and &#60;span> is an inline element.

    <p><b>What is SVG?</b></p>
    <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a web-friendly vector file format. 
      As opposed to pixel-based raster files like JPEGs, 
      vector files store images via mathematical formulas based on points and lines on a grid. 
      This means that vector files like SVG can be significantly resized without losing any of their quality, 
      which makes them ideal for logos and complex online graphics.</p>
